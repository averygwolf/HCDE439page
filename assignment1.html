            For this assignment, I wanted to get four LED's to blink in morse code, to communicate the world 'hello'. I did this by getting the LED's to blink
            in a series of short and long sequences, where each LED represents a different letter.

            Here is the morse code reference I used to figure out which LED's needed to blink and for how long!

            Here is the schematic for my LED setup. I used four different LED's connected to pins 8 through 11. To figure out what resistor to use for each 
            LED I had to use Ohm's law to calculate the resistance needed. For the green, red and yellow LED's I calculated that the resistance needed was 
            160 ohms. For the white LED, I calculated that the resistance needed was 85 ohms. I replaced the 160 ohm and the 85 ohm resistor with 160 and 220 ohm
            resistors, respectively, due to what I had available.
