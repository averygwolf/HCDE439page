            For this assignment, I wanted to get four LED's to blink in morse code, to communicate the world 'hello'. I did this by getting the LED's to blink
            in a series of short and long sequences, where each LED represents a different letter.

            <p>
            Here is the morse code reference I used to figure out which LED's needed to blink and for how long!

            Here is the schematic for my LED setup.
