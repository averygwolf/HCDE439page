            For this assignment I used an IR receiver to receive signals from a remote that would allow you
            to speed up or slow down a dc motor!

            For this assignment, I used a DC motor in addition to an IR receiver. The DC motor was wired through a transistor
            as well as two capacitors to handle noise that interferes with the IR receiver's ability to receive signals.

            Here is the schematic for my libraries setup. I used a 10k potentiometer for the LCD display and a 10k ohm resistor
            for the button. A 10k potentiometer is ideal for the amount of voltage I'm using and the current I want to draw. 
            I used a 10k resistor for the button - using ohm's law, with 5V as the voltage and 0.5mA as the current, 10,000 ohms
            is ideal for limiting the current flowing.
                
            I also included a 220ohm resistor for the LCD display, but it is unecessary and was included when I thought
            I'd utilize an LED - I took all my photos and drew my schematic before realizing that it was still there for no reason. :(
