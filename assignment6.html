            For this assignment I used a photoresistor and a button to communicate with a webpage!

            <p> 
            For this assignment, I used a DC motor in addition to an IR receiver. The DC motor was wired through a transistor
            as well as two capacitors to handle noise that interferes with the IR receiver's ability to receive signals.

            <p>
            Here is the schematic for my circuit setup! I used two capacitors to reduce the noise from the DC motor. There is a 100nF cap
            in parallel for the IR receiver and a 330 muF capacitor for the motor. To be transparent, the noise from the DC motor was not
            something I had expected to encounter and I had to do some online research to see how others had solved this problem - I found
            someone saying they solved the noise issue on Stack Exchange using a 100nf and a 100uf capacitor so I used the 100nf capacitor I had
            and tried using the only other capacitor I had which was a 330 muF!
