            For this assignment I used a photoresistor and a button to communicate with a webpage!

            For this assignment, I used a photoresistor and a pushbutton to send signals to a webpage that would
            change based on interaction with those inputs! Pushing the button will change the words in the upper left corner
            to say 'the button is pressed: YES'. Depending on how much light the photoresistor is receiving, the background of the
            webpage will change to indicate whether the photoresistor is in the dark, in full brightness, or somewhere in between!

            Here is the schematic for my circuit setup! I used two capacitors to reduce the noise from the DC motor. There is a 100nF cap
            in parallel for the IR receiver and a 330 muF capacitor for the motor. To be transparent, the noise from the DC motor was not
            something I had expected to encounter and I had to do some online research to see how others had solved this problem - I found
            someone saying they solved the noise issue on Stack Exchange using a 100nf and a 100uf capacitor so I used the 100nf capacitor I had
            and tried using the only other capacitor I had which was a 330 muF!
